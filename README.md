This is a [page template](http://codex.wordpress.org/Page_Templates) for a WordPress Twenty Fifeteen [child theme](http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes).

##To use:
1. Create a child theme of Twenty Fifeteen and place this file in it's directory. 
2. Activate your new child theme.
2. Customize the URLs in the file (the URLs are described in ALL CAPS).
3. Create a new page and switch the template to "Blank Page."
4. Use the text editor to enter the html that will be displayed between the body tags.

5. Upload a syle sheet for the page to your child theme directoy.
6. Add a "Stylesheet" custom field where the "value" is the name of the css file (without the .css extention).
